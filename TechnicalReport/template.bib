abstract = {In this paper we propose a benchmark dataset for crop/weed discrimination, single plant phenotyping and other open computer vision tasks in precision agriculture. The dataset comprises 60 images with annotations and is available online (http://​github.​com/​cwfid). All images were acquired with the autonomous field robot Bonirob in an organic carrot farm while the carrot plants were in early true leaf growth stage. Intra- and inter-row weeds were present, weed and crop were approximately of the same size and grew close together. For every dataset image we supply a ground truth vegetation segmentation mask and manual annotation of the plant type (crop vs. weed). We provide initial results for the phenotyping problem of crop/weed classification and propose evaluation methods to allow comparison of different approaches. By opening this dataset to the community we want to stimulate research in this area where the current lack of public datasets is one of the barriers for progress.},

	abstract = {MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS automatically learn programs from data. This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.},

@article{Ratsch2004,
	abstract = {The Machine Learning field evolved from the broad field of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to mimic intelligent abilities of humans by machines. In the field of Ma- chine Learning one considers the important question of how to make machines able to “learn”. Learning in this context is understood as inductive inference, where one observes examples that represent incomplete information about some “statistical phe- nomenon”. In unsupervised learning one typically tries to uncover hidden regularities (e.g. clusters) or to detect anomalies in the data (for instance some unusual machine function or a network intrusion). In supervised learning, there is a label associated with each example. It is supposed to be the answer to a question about the example. If the label is discrete, then the task is called classification problem – otherwise, for real- valued labels we speak of a regression problem. Based on these examples (including the labels), one is particularly interested to predict the answer for other cases before they are explicitly observed. Hence, learning is not only a question of remembering but also of generalization to unseen cases.},
